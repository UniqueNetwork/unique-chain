- refactor: Remove `#[transactional]` from extrinsics 7fd36cea2f6e00c02c67ccc1de9649ae404efd31

Every extrinsic now runs in transaction implicitly, and
`#[transactional]` on pallet dispatchable is now meaningless

- refactor: Switch to new prefix removal methods 26734e9567589d75cdd99e404eabf11d5a97d975

New methods allows to call `remove_prefix` with limit multiple times
in the same block
However, we don't use prefix removal limits, so upgrade is
straightforward

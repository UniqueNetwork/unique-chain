        # review" the workflow will immediately be passing (since it was skipped),

        # the workflow to start. This is also disclosed in:
        # https://github.community/t/dont-run-actions-on-draft-pull-requests/16817/17
        # That scenario would open an opportunity for the check to be bypassed:
        # 1. Get your PR approved
        # 2. Move it to Draft
        # 3. Push whatever commits you want
        # 4. Move it to "Ready for review"; now the workflow is passing (it was
        #    skipped) and "Check reviews" is also passing (it won't be updated
        #    until the workflow is finished)

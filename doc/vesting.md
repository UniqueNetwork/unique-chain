# Vesting

The goal of vesting feature is to provide the capability to freeze tokens until certain time.

In order to optimize storage used for chain state, as well as keep the rest of functionality simple and intact, vesting is provided via a separate dictionary and set of methods:

## VestedTransfer

### Description
This method transfers tokens to a vesting account with pre-defined vesting period. The token will not show up as owned by the recipient address, but will not be shown as owned by the previous owner (sender) either. Instead, it will be shown as owned by a special value address - Vesting address (with unknown private key). After the vesting timestamp, token can be claimed using VestingClaim method, which will transfer the token to the recipient address.
